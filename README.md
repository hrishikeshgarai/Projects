#PROJECTS & PROGRAMS. Work in progress!!!

This repository contains all the programs I have done as a part of my graduate coursework and also, otherwise. It also consists of graduate projects and also all the independent projects.

The repository has five folders: Python, C++, VHDL, C and Java.

Python has few codes which are a part of my ongoing course, High Speed Networks. Others are independent from my coursework and belong to HackerRank. Codes in C are specific to the graduate course Real-Time Embedded Systems. All codes in C++ and VHDL are from my graduate courses Computer Architecture and Advanced Hardware Design respectively. Java codes are independent of my graduate coursework.

PS: VHDL, Java and C programs are yet to be uploaded and will be done soon!
